All game programming uses a standard 10:17 coordinate system. The primary
gameplay happens within a 300x510 "gameplay" box. A larger 400x600 background box
defines the maximum screen extent on any platform, giving a maximum side margin
of 50 pixels per side and a maximum top margin of 45 pixels per side. The gameplay
box is centered inside the background box.

We define the bottom left of the gameplay box to be the origin in world
coordinates and all objects to have a bottom left pivot point. This maps Unity
screen coordinates directly to world coordinates. Thus, the background box is
positioned at world coordinates (-50, -45) and the main camera is positioned at
world coordinates (150, 255, -10).

On some platforms like iOS, it's desirable to render a bit of the game background
under the status bar. This can be acheived by setting the camera size to be the
actual resolution of the screen and employing a smaller gameplay box. For example,
for an iPad, the screen resolution is 1536x2048 with the status bar occupying the
top 40 pixels of the screen. The "gameplay" box is defined to be just 1181x2008
with the camera positioned at screen coordinates (590, 1024) instead of (590, 1004)
and the camera size set to 1024.

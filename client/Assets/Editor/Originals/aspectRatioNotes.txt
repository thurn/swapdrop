All game programming uses a standard 10:17 coordinate system. The primary
gameplay happens within a 300x510 "gameplay" box. A larger 400x600 viewport box
defines the maximum screen extent on any platform, giving a maximum side margin
of 50 pixels and a maximum top margin of 45 pixels. The gameplay box is centered
inside the viewport box.

We define the bottom left of the gameplay box to be the origin in world
coordinates and all objects to have a bottom left pivot point. This maps Unity
screen coordinates directly to world coordinates. Thus, the viewport box is
positioned at world coordinates (-50, -45) and the main camera is positioned at
world coordinates (150, 255).

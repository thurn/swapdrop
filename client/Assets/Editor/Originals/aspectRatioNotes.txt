All game programming uses a standard 10:17 coordinate system. The primary
gameplay happens within a 300x510 "gameplay" box. A larger 360x540 viewport box
defines the maximum screen extent on any platform, giving a side margin of 30
pixels and a top margin of 15 pixels. The gameplay box is centered inside the
viewport box.

We define the bottom left of the gameplay box to be the origin in world
coordinates and all objects to have a bottom left pivot point. This maps Unity
screen coordinates directly to world coordinates. Thus, the viewport box is
positioned at world coordinates (-30, -15) and the main camera is positioned at
world coordinates (150, 255).

Here are some estimated scaled resolutions on various devices:

## iPhone 5
- Device resolution: 640x1096
- Game resolution: 640x1088
- Margins: 8 pixel top margin.

## iPhone 6
- Device resolution: 750x1294
- Game resolution: 750x1275
- Margins: 19 pixel top margin.

## iPhone 6+
- Device resolution: 1080x1880
- Game resolution: 1080x1836
- Margins: 44 pixel top margin.

## Galaxy S5
- Device resolution: 1080x1845

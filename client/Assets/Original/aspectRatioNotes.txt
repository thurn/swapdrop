All game programming uses a standard coordinate system. The primary gameplay
happens with a 300x510 "gameplay" box. A larger viewport box defines the maximum
screen extent on any platform, it is 360x540. The gameplay box is centered inside
the viewport box.

Following Unity convention, we define screen center as the origin in world coordinates.
Thus, the bottom left point of the gameplay box is at coordinates (-150, -255) and the top
right point is at (150, 255).

Here are some estimated scaled resolutions on various devices:

## iPhone 5
- Device resolution: 640x1096
- Game resolution: 640x1088
- Margins: 8 pixel top margin.

## iPhone 6
- Device resolution: 750x1294
- Game resolution: 750x1275
- Margins: 19 pixel top margin.

## iPhone 6+
- Device resolution: 1080x1880
- Game resolution: 1080x1836
- Margins: 44 pixel top margin.

## Galaxy S5
- Device resolution: 1080x1845
- Game resolution: 1080x1836
- Margins: 9 pixel top margin

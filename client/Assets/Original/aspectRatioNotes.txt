All game programming uses a standard coordinate system. The primary gameplay
happens with a 600x1020 "gameplay" box. A larger viewport box defines the maximum
screen extent on any platform, it is 720x1080. The gameplay box is centered inside
the viewport box.

Following Unity convention, we define screen center as the origin. Thus, the bottom
left point of the gameplay box is at coordinates (-300, -510) and the top right point
is at (300, 510).

Here are some estimated resolutions on varoius devices:

## Development Mode
- Game resolution: 300x510
- Half-sized resolution to fit on laptop screen.

## iPhone 5
- Device resolution: 640x1096
- Game resolution: 640x1088
- Margins: 8 pixel top margin.

## iPhone 6
- Device resolution: 750x1294
- Game resolution: 750x1275
- Margins: 19 pixel top margin.

## iPhone 6+
- Device resolution: 1080x1880
- Game resolution: 1080x1836
- Margins: 44 pixel top margin.

## Galaxy S5
- Device resolution: 1080x1845
